I'm a **software developer** from **Germany** that loves to **build** products fast and **design** features by the **80:20** rule.

I have deliever cross-plattform **apps** using **React Native**, build **frontend** applications with **React** and Angular and can build **backend** services in **Node**, C#, Java and Python.

**Clojure** and **ClojureScript** are my favorite languages. I'm also interested in **F#**, Kotlin and Elm.
Most of my time is spent writing **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** code. I also had exposure to (excluding prev. mentioned) **Haskell**, C++, C, ASM.

**Modern tools** and **processes** are **important** to me. I develop in an **agile** way, using **CI/CD** platforms and a **digital-first** approach.

I love **working** in **teams** but am also **comfortable** handling the entire feature **delivery** process **on my own**. I have multiple years of experience using design tools like **Figma** and the **Adobe** Suite, have worked **independently** on an **app** for a small startup and have acted as a **project-manager** for multiple successful projects during my **bachelor** in applied **computer science**.
