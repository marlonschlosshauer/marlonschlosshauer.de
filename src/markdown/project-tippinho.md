**Amateur Soccer Prediction Platform**
Position: **CTO** 04.2022 - 11.2022

**Tippinho** is a platform where you and your friends can come together and make friendly predictions on upcoming matches in various amateur soccer leagues. You can then compare your predictions to your friends predictions. All this is done through an app.

As the only **app developer** at Tippinho it was my job to handle everything relating to our core product: The Tippinho App. Backend development was handled by another developer.

*Some of my many roles include:*
- Requirements Engineering
- UX prototyping and design
- Making Architecture decisions
- Actual Implementation
- Deployment to Stores
- Maintance and bug fixes
- Creating feature roadmaps

**React Native** was choosen early on because of my familiarity with **React** and the possible interoperability with other JS packages.

We choose **GraphQL** as a communication medium because it allowed us to shift the implementation of specific endpoints towards the frontend.

**TypeScript** was added early on to provide type hints. Thanks to GraphQL schemas (and the interactive tools out there) it was really easy to get accurate types for our data flows.

To enable payed subscribptions and in-app purchases we used **RevenueCat**, because it offered a unified and easy to use API. That allowed me to seperate purchasing logic and reduce it to an absolute minimum.

I was happy to see that not only mockups were present, but that they were done in **Figma**, my prefered design tool. I continued to use Figma for designing and feedback gathering.
