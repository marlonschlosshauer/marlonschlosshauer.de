# Design Engineering + Pareto Principle = [Marlon](https://github.com/marlonschlosshauer)

I‘m a full-stack developer that loves to code, design and optimise products into reality. I‘m a firm believer in compromise. Time is limited and ideas are infinite. We can get a lot done if we‘re brave enough to focus, narrow scope and ship incrementally.

After finishing my [bachelors thesis](https://github.com/marlonschlosshauer/thesis) in applied computer science I joined [Tippinho](https://www.figma.com/design/Wg2c9sk6nqbeWrydDOxCMg/Portfolio--Tippinho?node-id=0-1&t=euCBXXiFDOqdV9dh-1) as their app developer and designer. During my time there I also worked on [Neo Strom](https://www.figma.com/design/vbdX85EQ4ALcO1Txeeu4do/Portfolio--Neo-Strom?node-id=0-1&t=qyTLYo9BRQ5HifD8-1), filling a technical and design role. I later took on a full-time position as a frontend developer at Becklyn, building CMS powered websites. While working full-time I also worked on [Secondwave](https://www.figma.com/design/KgLQExaQWOnNiDD7zsw6e9/Portfolio--Secondwave?node-id=0-1&t=jy94MQDD9AeEXfUE-1) as a designer and developer on the side. Afterwards I did a redesign of Tippinho, called [Golero](https://www.figma.com/design/Wg2c9sk6nqbeWrydDOxCMg/Portfolio--Tippinho?node-id=6-5924&t=VgC4hyVQZblLkrTo-4).
