# Signing, React Native and the Play Store

<Meta {...metadata} />

To deploy their app to the Play Store, developers have to generate a `.keystore` file and sign their release with it. The [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android) do a good job explaining the necessary steps.

To summarize, as of right now (Version `0.70` on macOS) all you have to do is:

1. Navigate to your JDK folder by following the output of `/usr/libexec/java_home` 2. Run `sudo
keytool -genkey -v -keystore {NAME}.keystore -alias {ALIAS} -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity
10000` (with `{NAME}` and `{ALIAS}` replaced, e.g `tippinho.keystore`) 3. Fill out the prompt 4.
   Place the generated `{NAME}.keystore` file in `/android/app` 5. Add the following to your
   `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` (with the correct values):

```gradle
MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE={NAME}.keystore
MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS={ALIAS}
MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=*****
MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=*****
```

Again, check out the [official docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android) for up-to-date and more detailed instructions.

## So you lost your keystore, what now?

No big deal - as long as you let Google Play manage your signing key. Assuming that, the steps are straightforward. The React Native docs point you to [this support article](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9842756?visit_id=638050049051152094-2056461076&rd=1#reset) which tells you to [go here and follow the instructions](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/key).

Those instructions being:

1. Generate a new `.jks` file

```shell
keytool -genkeypair -alias upload -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 9125 -keystore keystore.jks
```

2. Generate a `.pem` file from that `.jks`

```shell
keytool -export -rfc -alias upload -file upload_certificate.pem -keystore keystore.jks  *
```

3. Send it to Google via the form

I left the actual commands **untouched** to point out that Google default to use `upload` as
an `alias` (where the React Native Docs default to `my-key-alias`). This means the `.keystore` that
you will generate later to sign your app again will need to have that alias, too! So be careful with
what you put here. **Always have your aliases match**. Keep in mind that the `gradle.properties` in
`~/.gradle/` also references that `alias`!

## What I also learned

-   Don't panic! If you have Google Play sign your app you will gain access again (assuming you know your Play login)
-   In my experience the support takes less than 24h to reset your key
-   Once reset, the new key will become active after an additional 48h
-   If you just have the `.perm` file you can't do anything
-   If you just have the `.keystore` file you can't do anything
-   If you just have the `.jks` all you need to do is generate a new `.keystore` with the same alias
-   The initial `.jks` file should be generated from the initial `keytool -genkey` command
-   You can't generate a `.jks` from a `.keystore`, don't bother
-   I recommend backing up the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` because you will lose it at some point
