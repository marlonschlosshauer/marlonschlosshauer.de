# Writing macros that consume ClojureScript code

Clojure macros are extremely powerful but I had issues finding a simple ressource on how to make them work in ClojureScript - and with ClojureScript code. So, here are two ways that worked for me.

## Single `.cljc` file

The quickest way to create macros, is to rename our `.cljs` file to a `.cljc` file. We then can use the `defmacro` function to create our macro. Though because we're not in a `.cljs` file anymore, we can't import ClojureScript code. This means two things for us:

1. We need to import the required ClojureScript namespace (`example.bar`) wherever we want to use our macro, as well as also importing the macro ns (`example.foo`)!
2. The namespace of the ClojureScript function which we call in our macro (`bar`), needs to be spelled out completely (`example.bar/bar`) in our macro.

```clojure
  (ns example.foo)

  (defmacro code []
    ;; bar is the cljs function we want to call
    ;; notice how we spelled out the ns completely!
    (example.bar/bar))
```

## Both `.cljs` + `.clj`

If we want separate namespaces we can first define our ClojureScript code in a `.cljs` file and later define our macro in a `.clj` file. The `.cljs` file can import the macro. The macro can reference the ClojureScript namespace. Same as before applies for spelling out the namespace completely in the macro, as well as importing the necessary namespace (`example.bar`) before being able to use the macro.

```clojure
  ;; foo.clj
  (ns example.foo)

  (defmacro code []
    ;; we want to call bar function in our macro
    ;; .cljs ns is spelled out completely in this .clj file
    (example.bar/bar))

  ;; bar.cljs
  (ns example.bar
    (:require-macros [example.foo :as foo]))

  (defn bar []
    ...) ;; this function will be called in our macro

  (defn run-macro-that-calls-bar []
    (foo/code))
```
